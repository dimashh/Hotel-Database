HOTEL SYSTEM
A hotel has rooms of three types: excellent, deluxe and magnificent. It has several rooms of each of these types, but all rooms of a particular type are priced the same and have the same facilities. Each room is situated on only one floor of the hotel, and a room is identified by the floor number followed by another two-digit number. Customers may book accommodation for a particular type of room for a single period or may make several bookings for several visits to the hotel. For each booking they would specify the names of the people who would be staying. Thus a person may wish to make a booking for themselves alone, or with a friend or possibly with a friend and child. In any case, no more than three people may share a room. The hotel assigns these people to an appropriate available room. Each type of room has a basic price and the cost of the room with several guests is calculated from this basic price, the type of room, and the number of guests sharing the room. Your system must be able to support the storage of the above information, including being able to track the guests included on a particular booking, and the guests allocated to each hotel room.
